# ThePlot_Ladle
Hi! We are Jasmine, Irene, Rosa and Daniele. During our learning experience at the Apple developer Academy we created this project. The app is called Ladle and its goal is to help parents and children who want to spend more time together by providing a funny, engaging and educational cooking game.
It consists of a collection of recipes with easy to follow steps. The app can be experienced in two ways. The child and parent can either play directly with the recipes provided or they can follow the steps simultaneously, the child on the iPad and the parent with real ingredients so that at the end they can compare the results by taking a picture, thanks to the camera feature built into the app.

Moreover, the experience is even more engaging for the child because each time he/she opens the app it’s possible to choose a different animal as avatar. The avatar will help the child along during the recipes’ process providing written directions (for when the child is in the company of an adult and said adult can read them) and drawings that highlight the actions that have to be made to complete the current step of the recipe.

There is also the possibility to come back to a previous step with the use of the Timeline. This features gives the child the possibility to repeat the steps and interactions that they loved the most by simply tapping on the corresponding number. The timeline is also interactive (the avatar face moves along the timeline indicating the progress in the recipe steps).

Each recipe has different difficulty level and more complex interactions. The easiest one is the ice-cream recipe in which the interactions are the drag and drop of the ingredients and the shake action to blend said ingredients, once they have been dropped into the blender. 

The more engaging and complex recipe is the pizza recipe. This recipe has many steps and calls for different interactions: during the steps of said recipe the child will have to not only drag and drop the ingredient to create the dough but also work it with swiping action, tap it to make it grow and also recreate circular motions in order to spread the salsa on the dough once it has been rolled out. Then they can proceed to drag the raw pizza into the oven to cook it.

We think that it’s also important to highlight that all the assets that you find in the project have been created by us, according to the color palette and the aesthetic of the project itself.

During the developing process of the app we also decided to add some animations to make the experience even more engaging and intuitive for the child.
We hope you like our project, we had a lot of fun developing it, from the first brainstorming day up until the very last coding day.
